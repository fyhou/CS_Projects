testall script:
	- 90 points of the testall script past successfully
	- the 10 points that do not pass are because of test203, where an error occurs
	  if you use csh; I spoke to the TAs about this in my lab and they said it was fine;
	  you can do the commands manually and see that the subshell works correctly

line editor:
	- everything works
