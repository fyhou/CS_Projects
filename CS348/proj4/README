Project: Purdue CT (Project 4)
Date:    12/01/2012

Instructions: 
	- Open project in Eclipse (main method is located in PurdueCT.java)
	- Probably need to add .jar file to compilation path:
		- In Eclipse, right click proj4 -> Properties -> Java Build Path -> Libraries -> Add External JARs and add file that is in proj4/tools/
	- Run program in Eclipse

Database schema:
	faculty (fid, fname, password) where fid is primary key
	class (cname, semester, year, meets_at, room, fid) where cname is primary key
	enrolled (snum, cname) where (snum, cname) is primary key, snum refrences student(snum) and cname references class(cname)
	evaluation (name, type, weight, deadline, room, cname) where (name, cname) is primary and cname references class(cname)
	grade (snum, cname, mark, name) where (snum, name, cname) is primary key
	message (message, cname) where (message, cname) is primary key

Users:
	- Faculty (user name / password):
		- F1 / F1
		- F2 / F2
	- Student (user name / password):
		- S1 / S1
		- S2 / S2

Optional Features Implemented:
	- I implemented both the ability to send mesages to classes for faculty and getting all messages of classes that a student is enrolled in for students.
