Lab 5

No special instructions to compile the modified Linux kernel other than the instructions 
given in the lab spec. My test for my_stack_trace simply calls the newly created system 
call. So to see if the system call does what it's supposed to do, you have to check the
kernel log to see the stack trace by calling "dmesg".
