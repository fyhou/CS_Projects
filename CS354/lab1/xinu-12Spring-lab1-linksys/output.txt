Task 2.1 Output (without spawned processes):
Process name: Main process
Process priority: 20
Process stack size: 65536
Process stack address: 81ffffa0

Task 2.3 Output (with spawned processes):
Process name: Main process
Process priority: 20
Process stack size: 65536
Process stack address: 81ffff08

Process name: process 1
Process priority: 20
Process stack size: 1000
Process stack address: 81feff20

Process name: process 2
Process priority: 20
Process stack size: 950
Process stack address: 81fefb38


** The Main Process is outputted because it is a running process in the system.
I asked my TA during my PSO if this process was to be included in the output and
he told me it was fine. However, I do make a check in my system call if whether
or not the process is the null process that is always running and do not print
it if it is. This was an interesting lab and I look forward to the next one!
