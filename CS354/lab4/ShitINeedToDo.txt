CS 354 Lab 4 Shit I Need To Do
------------------------------

System Requirements
-------------------
1. make another table like queuetab[] to hold queued Senders that are in SENNDING state: sendqueue[]
2. define PR_SND state in process.h to put Senders in that are blocked

Sender Requirements
-------------------
1. define new function sendb() that behaves like send(), but blocks if receiver is full
2. modify process' process table entry by adding two fields: umsg32 sndmsg and char sndflag
	2a. sndmsg holds the message the Sender is sending
	2b. sndflag determines if sndmsg is legit

Receiver Requirements
---------------------
1. define new function receiveb() that acts like receive() (start by copying code)
2. receiveb() should release the blocked sender process S when S's message is received
3. before returning (after getting a message), must check if there are any blocked sending processes
   in sendqueue[]
	3a. if so, unblock the first one and put it into READY state (assuming by putting message in sndmsg
        into prmsg of receiver for next one
    3b. if not, just return
